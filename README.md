DIY Streamdeck code for arduino

This Repo merges the code from this [DIY macropad](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/diy-stream-deck-mini-macro-keyboard/) by [Dave Madison](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/about/) and [Deej volume mixer](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/blob/master/arduino/deej-5-sliders-vanilla/deej-5-sliders-vanilla.ino) by [omriharel](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) following the instructions from [at thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4653473).

This project combines a basic 2x4 macropad with 4 sliders to control the volume.
